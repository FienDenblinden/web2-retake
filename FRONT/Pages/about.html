                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>Temperatura is a company started up by Fien Denblinden (19).
                    Originally this site was set up for Fien's school project,
                    but because of her enormously driven ambition and passion for weather and climate,
                    she decided to start a company called Temperatura.
                    This company is specialized in making weather forecasts,
                    thanks to their good, reliable sources of information.
                    Temperatura is therefore the ideal site for temperature,
                    precipitation, air pressure,… of today, tomorrow and the next 5 days.

                <h2>Our goals</h2>
                <p>All employees of the Temperatura company have an enormous passion
                    and interest in weather and climate. On the one hand, we hope to share this passion
                    with others and and ignite other people with our passion,
                    because nowadays, a weatherman or weather woman is still a bottleneck profession.
                    But on the other hand, this site is of course super handy for anyone who wants to know
                    what the weather will be like to know what clothes he/she is going to wear, to know if
                    he/she can eat outside, to know which activities are suitable, to know if
                    there will be a traffic jam due to bad weather conditions,…. In short, our goal is to trigger people
                    with our passion, but also to inform people.</p>
